					My name is Shejan Shuza, I am a computer expert with 16 years of various computer experience. I am a big fan of everything graphics, game engines,
					and rendering. I am currently a Bachelor's student at UTSA planned to graduate in Spring 2022. I currently hold a 3.95 GPA. I really want to work
					in the game industry, primarily that of Rockstar Games, or a large AAA studio. I am a big fan of the Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto, Assassin's 
 					Creed, and Batman Arkham series. I have wroked in Unity before, for both a Game Development class and an internship for Professor Quarles 
					with his medical training company, MedCognition.

				During the 2020-21 COVID-19 pandemic I worked on a project called Terra 1-to-1 with a friend of mine, Adam. It is a Minecraft mod that utilizes the 
				OpenCubicChunks (a mod that enables Minecraft's chunk systems to be stored in a cubic format, each chunk having 256 block heights each) 
				to build a new world generator that is based on online datasets to generate earth's terrain and geographic features in a 1-to-1 scale, previous 
				implementations had only been able to achieve 1:32 or 1:25 scales, but this was the first implementation at 1:1. This mod sparked the creation
				of another project, the Build the Earth project, which uses Terra 1-to-1 as the basis for the world generation, then project volunteers would
				build man-made constructions in 1:1 scale as a massive detailed catalog of the earth in its actual scale.
